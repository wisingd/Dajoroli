Split It is a finance app that targets young mobile people with
active and interactive economic lives. Whether you want to split a
tab, pay your part of a group expense or keep track of mutual debts,
Split It is the app for you. With the possibility to invite your
contacts to share a tab or an economic event it’s easy to organize
your joint payment. When your contacts accept the invite the mutual
debts are automatically recalculated. The ease of use is what will
make you want to use it – every day.
